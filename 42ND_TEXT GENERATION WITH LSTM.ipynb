        "Recurrent neural networks are also known for their ability to generate text. As a result, the neural network's output can be free-form text. This section will demonstrate how to train an LSTM on a textual document, such as classic literature, and learn to output new text that appears to be of the same form as the training material. If you train your LSTM on [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), it will learn to crank out new prose similar to what Shakespeare had written. \n",

The prose generated by your neural network will be nonsensical. However, the output text will usually be nearly grammatically correct and similar to the source training documents. \n",
        "\n",
        "A neural network generating nonsensical text based on literature may not seem helpful. However, this technology gets so much interest because it forms the foundation for many more advanced technologies. The LSTM will typically learn human grammar from the source document opens a wide range of possibilities. You can use similar technology to complete sentences when entering text. The ability to output free-form text has become the foundation of many other technologies. In the next part, we will use this technique to create a neural network that can write captions for images to describe what is going on in the picture. \n",

The most basic question is if you wish the neural network to learn at the word or character level. Learning at the character level is the more interesting of the two. The LSTM is learning to construct its own words without even being shown what a word is. We will begin with character-level text generation. In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level. We will implement word-level automatic captioning in the next module.\n",

You will divide the text into sequences of this length, and the neural network will train to predict what comes after this sequence."
