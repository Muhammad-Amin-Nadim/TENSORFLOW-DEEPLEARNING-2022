        "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.  Python has become a common language for machine learning research and is the primary language for TensorFlow. \n",
        "\n",
        "Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a significant revision of the language that is not entirely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.  This course makes use of Python 3.  Furthermore, TensorFlow is not compatible with versions of Python earlier than 3. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation (PSF), manages and directs resources for Python development. On January 1, 2020, the PSF discontinued the Python 2 language and no longer provides security patches and other improvements. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first two modules of this course provide an introduction to some aspects of the Python programming language.  However, entire books focus on Python.  Two modules will not cover every detail of this language.  The reader is encouraged to consult additional sources on the Python language.\n",

        "This code illustrates some incompatibilities between Python 2 and Python 3.  Before Python 3, it was acceptable to leave the parentheses off of a *print* function call.  This method of invoking the *print* command is no longer allowed in Python 3.  Similarly, it used to be a performance improvement to use the *xrange* command in place of range command at times.  Python 3 incorporated all of the functionality of the *xrange* Python 2 command into the normal *range* command.  As a result, the programmer should not use the *xrange* command in Python 3.  If you see either of these constructs used in example code, then you are looking at an older Python 2 era example.\n",

Collections, as well as the operations that loops can perform on them, is covered later in this module.\n",
